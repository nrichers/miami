# Think back to February 2022 ...

- We had nothing. 

<!-- Annual review prep — treat it like a job interview 
- Prepare updated CV with highlights
- Include links to best work samples
    - Docs site revamp
    - API reference 
    - Chatbot MVP
    - Product demos
    - Team building and community processes
- Areas for improvement:
    - Community is half-starved for lack of resources
    - Taking the lead on OSS
- If no director title:
    - If mentoring or working towards is mentioned
        - Makes sense for established corporations
        - People join startups to further their careers (nobody has time to run a mentoring program)
        - I perform at the same level as a Spencer or a Roof
    - Else be silent
- Create a GitHub page you could show w/ work samples

# Think back to the summer of 2023 in Vancouver ...

- Our first users!
- Competitive evaluation
- Our own community & open-source

## Our own community

::: {.f2}
- **Enables you to use ValidMind** — for customer onboarding, feature adoption, product-led growth
- **Enables you to do MRM or AI risk better** — for newcomers to the industry, for leaders in model risk governance
:::

<hr>

::: {.f2}
**Enables us to scale** — 'know-how in a box'

   - Bottom-up adoption of ValidMind — support self-service & trials
   - Open source software (OSS) dissemination
:::

<!-- - Avoid content siloes -->

# Community next steps

- [Training program proposal](#training-program-proposal)

# Training program proposal

- <https://github.com/validmind/training-stockholm-2024>

# Priorities

**TL;DR:** What Jonas and Mehdi said.

::: {.f3}
(Practically, this means stepping up content creation — docs, training, demos, samples. If we're not creating these now, we will. To accelerate, we need to build out the team.)

<!-- **Self-service, enablement** -->

<!-- - Onboarding, training content ready to consume
- Tech feature content ready to consume
- Migration to ValidMind case studies to support GTM -->

# Year THREE 

## What? 

::: {.f3}
> FINOS (Fintech Open Source Foundation) is a nonprofit organization sponsored by the Linux Foundation that promotes open innovation in the financial services sector. It provides a collaborative platform where financial institutions, technology firms, and individual contributors can work together to develop open-source software, standards, and best practices. The aim is to drive efficiency, innovation, and interoperability within the industry. FINOS also supports various projects and working groups that address specific challenges and opportunities in financial technology.
:::

::: {.f2}
Membership organizations sponsor developers to engage in open source. It's a viable path to get our open-source developer tools in front of the largest open-source developer audience in fintech.

<!-- (start small, then expand to use more) -->

**Two opportunities to engage, one paid, one free.**
:::

## Paid: AI Readiness Initiative

::: {.f2}
> Our goal is to mutually develop a **governance framework** that manages the on-boarding, development of, and running AI-based solutions within financial services organisations - allowing us all to unlock the potential of this disruptive technology in a safe, trustworthy and compliant way.

Member only, 20-30 banks — price tag: USD 20K for Silver FINOS memberhip + USD 5k for Linux Foundation membership

<https://github.com/finos/ai-readiness>
:::

## Free: LLM Exploration Project

::: {.f2}
> Reference Architectures: find ... use cases and build demo applications stitching together existing open source solutions

> **“Model Creation & Evaluation Engine**" ... Evaluating the Open Source Climate Data Commons (contributed by RedHat) ... for developing a public/private data store ... Building on the work done by the AI4Finance team (FinGPT, FinBen paper on financial benchmarks) ... **for developing a suite of benchmarking tools**.
